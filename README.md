Design and practical implementation of a voltage-controlled audio frequency preamplifier respecting a set of requirements.


To design and practically realize an audio frequency preamplifier with voltage control having the following characteristics:

- Supply voltage of the bipolar circuit VCC = 13 V , VEE = - VCC = - 13 V
( |VCC| =|VEE| )
-  The presence of voltage will be signaled with an LED.
-  Sinusoidal input voltage to the circuit with amplitude between [0 , 30] mV .
- Input signal frequency of 3 kHz.
- Continuous control voltage of the amplification between [0.3] V .
- Controlled voltage amplification between [1.30].
If the control voltage is equal to 0 V , then the output signal from the preamplifier is equal to the input signal ;
If the control voltage is equal to 3 V, then the output signal from the preamplifier is equal to the input signal amplified 30 times.
- Load resistance RL = 800 
